EZ minesweeper game y'all know. Done completely with AI. No code done by any human. 

I've spent like 2 days torturing AI to get me working code... 
and another day to make it look like not a toxic waste of sh.., burning my eyes like the mid-day Sun.

Anyway...
If I get back to this project im'ma just add dark mode or sth. IF I don't forget abt it.
